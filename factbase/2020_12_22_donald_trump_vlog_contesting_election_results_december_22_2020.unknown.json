    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "My fellow Americans. Today I want to explain to you why I am so determined to pursue every legal and constitutional option available to stop the theft of the presidential election. As President, one of my most solemn duties is to protect the integrity of your sacred right to vote. This year, using the virus as a pretext, Democrat officials in the key swing states illegally violated their own state laws in order to enable, encourage, and facilitate fraud on a scale never before seen in the history of our country."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "The truth is we won the election by a landslide. We won it big. Today, I'm going to give you the facts that every American needs to know. Let's go back to the night of the election. By midnight, we had a commanding lead in the swing states. We won Florida by a record number of votes. We won Ohio by a record number of votes."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "And likewise, we won Iowa by 8.2%, far different than the false narrative portrayed in the media. We were up by 293,000 votes in Michigan, 112,000 votes in Wisconsin, 356,000 votes in Georgia, and nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania, all swing states. These numbers were absolutely impossible for Joe Biden to overcome, and the Democrats knew it and everybody forecasting knew it and understood it well."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "Our nation's greatest political professionals were calling to congratulate me on our victory. Then suddenly everything started to disappear. Everything started to change. The vote counting abruptly stopped in multiple states. In the middle of the night, a series of massive and statistically inconceivable vote dumps overturned the results in state after state."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "At 6:31 AM, very early in the morning, Michigan suddenly reported 147,224 votes, 94% for Biden, 6% for Trump. At 4:42 AM, Wisconsin reported 143,279 votes, almost all of them for Biden. A similar massive drop of ballots happened in Georgia at 1:34 AM, again, almost all of these votes for Biden. These gigantic and ridiculously one-sided spikes were miraculously just enough to push Joe Biden into the lead in all of the key swing states."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "These glaring anomalies are just the tip of the iceberg. We won 18 of 19 bellwether counties, a record, that have correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election for the last 40 years. We also won Ohio, Florida, and Iowa by historic margins, meaning Biden would be the first candidate since 1960, and only the second candidate in American history to win the White House while losing all three of those major states, and it wasn't even close."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "With Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, the Democrats lost 25 out of 26 toss-up House seats. That's a record. Democrats were projected to gain 15 seats, and instead, because of my success and coattails, as they call 'em, they lost 14 seats. So think of that, they were going to win big and they ended up losing big."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "My campaign received more votes than any President in history. Almost 75 million people voted for me. We earned approximately 12 million more votes than we got in 2016, the largest vote increase for an incumbent President ever recorded. I also received the largest share of non-white voters of any Republican in over 60 years."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "In fact, we did better with African-American and Hispanic voters everywhere in the country except for a small handful of corrupt Democratic-run cities in key swing states, places notorious for fraud such as Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta, and Philadelphia, all run by Democrat machine politicians. No president has ever lost re-election while making such extraordinary gains across the board."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "There's never been anything like it. Yet despite all of this evidence of a thundering Trump victory and all of those projections all through the night, they want us to believe that Joe Biden, who seldom left his basement to campaign, somehow received 11.7 million more votes than Barack Obama. And he beat Barack Obama all over the country."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "It is historically, mathematically, politically, and logically impossible. It did not happen. He did not win. We won by a landslide. Over the past seven weeks, we have put forth the abundant evidence, proving how the Democrats perpetrated this monstrous fraud on the American people and indeed the world. First, we have shown that officials in virtually every key swing state brazenly violated their own state laws in order to change election procedures, eliminate safeguards, promote fraud, and illegally benefit Joe Biden and legislatures, which have to make the changes were seldom if ever used."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "For example, Pennsylvania's radical Democrat, Secretary of State suspended all signature verification requirements, breaking Pennsylvania law, not to mention the big and very illegal ballot drops. In Michigan, the Secretary of State, a Democrat illegally flooded the state with absentee ballot applications, even though Michigan law strictly limits the distribution of absentee ballots."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "In Wisconsin, the major Democrat cities deployed over 500 unmanned unsecured ballot drop boxes that were blatantly illegal paving the way for unlawful ballot harvesting and tremendous fraud. In Georgia, the Secretary of State began illegally processing ballots weeks before election day, and also destroyed the signature verification systems in violation of the law."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "Many other horrible things were done in Georgia. These actions alone were more than enough to rig the election results for Democrats. Second, the absentee ballot rejection rates prove that hundreds of thousands of illegitimate ballots were counted in the key States. This was sufficient to change the election results all in its own."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "In 2016, 6.4% of mail-in ballots were rejected in Georgia. This year, fewer than a tiny percentage of 1% were rejected. So you went all the way down, a difference of more than 30 times. The same phenomenon occurred in Pennsylvania and other States. They were accepting all of these ballots, many of which were absolutely illegal."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "In a year in which the number of mail-in ballots was the highest ever the rejection rate was magically the lowest ever. And it wasn't even close. The only possible explanation is that tens of thousands of ballots were unlawfully processed and counted. Most Americans would be shocked to learn that in no swing state is there any meaningful attempt to verify citizenship, residency, identity, or eligibility for mail in ballots."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "The potential for illegal activity is unlimited. And that's what we just experienced. Third, hundreds and hundreds of witnesses have come forward to testify under penalty of perjury about the cheating and fraud they saw with their own eyes. Witnesses have sworn that they saw poll workers illegally backdating thousands of ballots, counting batches of the same ballots many times and unloading boxes and boxes of ballots all bearing the same signature and offer Joe Biden."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "Other witnesses have testified to seeing thousands of so-called pristine ballots with no creases or folds, all voting for Biden. When you have no fold, it means it wasn't mailed, it means it was a fraud. Republican Poll Watchers were denied critical access as hundreds of thousands of votes were counted in Democrat run cities in the essential States."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "There is even security camera footage from Georgia that shows officials telling poll watchers to leave the room before pulling suitcases of ballots out from under the tables and continuing to count for hours. The reason they were forced to leave the room, as they said, there was a major water main break."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "The water main break never happened. There was no water main break. In many cases, Republican Poll Watchers were physically removed from rooms. In addition, there is the deeply troubling matter of dominion voting systems. In just one Michigan County alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same system was used throughout a majority of the United States."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "No satisfactory explanation has been offered for why Dominion Systems are able to switch votes with a mere push of a button, In Arizona, the State Senate has recently issued a subpoena for a forensic audit of the voting machines. And similar investigations must be conducted in every state using Dominion Systems immediately."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "In Texas, they don't allow Dominion Systems to be used. As I have just laid out, we have unveiled overwhelming evidence of election fraud. None of this should ever have been allowed to happen in the United States of America. It is a travesty of democracy. It's a shame upon our Republic. In 2016, we caught them by surprise."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "From that moment, they had four years to work on the scheme to rig the 2020 election. The rigging of the 2020 election was only the final step in the Democrats' and the media's years long effort to overthrow the will of the American people and destroy our movement by any means possible, any means necessary."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "For months and indeed years before the election, the media, the big tech giants and the Democrat Party were openly colluding to deceive the American public. Earlier this year was proven beyond any doubt that Joe Biden's family received millions of dollars from the Chinese Communist Party. Yet the media and tech companies worked together to completely censor this information."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "Our country no longer has a free press. It is a press of suppression. It is a press where the truth will never come out. It is the greatest and most shocking scandal involving a presidential candidate in modern history. But surveys show that half of those who voted for Joe Biden have never even heard of the story."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "This is not the first and only time that the media and the Biden campaign flagrantly lied to the American people. They repeatedly insisted that we would not produce a vaccine for the China virus before the middle of next year. And yet, before the end of this year, we have already authorized two vaccines with tens of millions of doses of distribution and hundreds of millions more on their way."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "This is being talked of as a great medical miracle. In this sense alone, the media and the Democrat Party lied to the American people to try to steal the election. Also, polls in order to deter voter turnout, the media had me down in certain polls by 15, 16, and 17% in States that I won or came very close to winning."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "If this egregious fraud is not fully investigated and addressed, the 2020 election will forever be regarded as illegitimate and the most corrupt election in the history of our country. Americans must be able to have complete faith and confidence in our elections. The fate of our democracy depends upon it."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "Now is the time for the American people to raise their voices and demand that this injustice be immediately corrected. Our elections must be fair, they must be honest and they must be transparent and they must be 100% free of fraud. We won this election by a magnificent landslide and the people of the United States know it."
  },
  {
    "Speaker": "Donald Trump",
    "Text": "All over they're demonstrating, they're angry, they're fearful. We can not allow a completely fraudulent election to stand. Thank you, God bless you. And God bless America."
